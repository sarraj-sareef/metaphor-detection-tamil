# metaphor-detection-tamil
metaphor detection and extraction for Tamil language
We propose a metaphor detection tool for Tamil language which is a low resource language. We will be creating a dataset for binary classification of metaphorical and non-metaphorical sentences and then will build the binary classification tool and then we will also create a dataset with metaphrical sentences annotated with target and source pairs. We will be implementing a metaphor extraction tool to extract the target and source pairs and produce output tagged with these two pairs
